# Breakers and Brokers

## Concept
B&B is a PvE "Extraction Game" where players gain power by scavenging the remains of ancient star-ships that dot the playfield, with each deployment into the zone asking the players to risk their breaker and personal equipment.

## Genre(s)
The game should utilize elements from looter-shooters, dungeon-crawlers, and multi-crew vehicle sims

## Target Audience
Me. I'm the target audience. I think this will be fun, and I know I'm not alone.

## Unique Selling Point
A middle-eastern inspired sci-fi setting in a game where players are constantly managing risk vs. reward.

## Player Experience and POV
The players are the crew member of a "breaker," a large vehicle designed to act as a cargo-hauler, living quarters, and tank while out scavenging ships in the setting's harsh desert environment. The game seeks to challenge the players by having them coordinate operating their breaker in order to protect themselves against hostile wild-life and bandit crews seeking the valuables inside the player's breaker. The game aims to provide two forms of challenge for the players in the form of combat onboard the breaker and combat on foot while actually breaking down the ancient derelict star-ships. The players should be looking forward to engaging combat and interesting rewards for either the breaker or their character.

## Visual and Audio Style
What if Homeworld was more grounded? The game's setting would have a sci-fi apocalypse feeling, with a hint of middle-eastern and eastern european influence.

## Game World Fiction
The player is a crew member onboard a "breaker," a massive desert roaming vehicle designed to protect and support a team of scavengers as they break down the abandoned starships that are scattered across the planet's surface.

## Monetization
The game should be a premium product, asking players to buy it in order to play. Additional funding can come in the form of premium cosmetics for either the player-characters or their breaker.

## Platform(s), Technology, Scope
PC, 3D, Unreal Engine 5

## Core Loops
Combat structure: Identify -> Plan -> Engage -> Adapt -> Move -> Loop

Ship-Breaking: Identify -> Plan -> Engage -> Adapt -> Move -> Loop

Build-Crafting structure: Plan Build -> Identify Needs -> Acquire -> Integrate -> Loop

Customization structure: Plan Appearance -> Acquire (monetization fits here) -> Integrate -> Loop

## Objectives and Progression
In the short-term, players will be focused on gathering equipment to make it through individual rounds. In the medium-term, players will be trying to gather equipment to create unique builds that fit their play style. The long-term goal for players would be aquiring cosmetics to customize their character(s) and appearance.

## Summary
This design document / map is intended to detail an Escape From Tarkov style "extraction shooter," made with elements taken from successful dedicated FPS games and looter-shooters. The intent is to create a game that has more casual appeal than Tarkov while also having more depth/complexity in it's progression system than Call of Duty's DMZ mode or Hunt Showdown.

The reason I want to make this game is because I think it'll be fun.
