## Overview
Combat onboard the Breaker should take inspiration from games like "War Thunder" or "Gunner, HEAT, PC!" where the players are fighting in an environment that feels realistic and follows reality where possible. That is, the damage model shouldn't be a simple health system for the Breaker, but rather the Breaker is destroyed when the individual sub-systems are damaged to the point that the Breaker as a whole is non-functional, or the entire crew is killed by enemy weapons penetrating the armor.

## Identify -> Plan -> Engage -> Adapt -> Move -> Loop

This loop is the super-structure of the game's combat, with each step representing singular or multiple actions. 

* Identify: The first step of combat, in the Identify stage the player team is determining [[Enemies|what they're about to fight]], so that they can begin the second stage.
* Plan: Different [[Enemies|enemies]] should require different tactics to effectively fight, such as using [[Defensive Systems|CIWS]] to engage in close range, or using the Breaker's [[Gunnery|main guns]] to engage from a longer range or deal with heavier armor.
* Engage: The players actually attempting to follow through on their initial plan. This is where complications can arise that necessitates stage 4. Potential complications could include additional [[Enemies|enemies]] coming into the fight, or the enemies having extra armor that is difficult to identify from far away.
* Adapt: The players have to remake or update their plan to properly fight off the enemies they're in combat with.
* Move: After defeating the enemy, the players continue moving towards their destination, which can result in them either reaching their destination or having to go through this loop again.
