## [[On Foot Combat]]
Combat outside the breaker should take inspiration from L4D and various other coop shooters on the market, with the added twist of the players fighting inside the dilapidated star-ships that they're scavenging, and the added destruction that implies.

## [[Vehicle Combat]]
Combat onboard the Breaker should take inspiration from games like "War Thunder" or "Gunner, HEAT, PC!" where the players are fighting in an environment that feels realistic and follows reality where possible. That is, the damage model shouldn't be a simple health system for the Breaker, but rather the Breaker is destroyed when the individual sub-systems are damaged to the point that the Breaker as a whole is non-functional, or the entire crew is killed by enemy weapons penetrating the armor.
