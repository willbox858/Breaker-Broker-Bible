![[Defensive Weapons.png]]
Pictured above is a mockup of the "Defensive Weapons Screen." From here, a play can manage the traversal and elevation of the various CIWS on the Breaker, setting each to the appropriate direction in order to target incoming threats. They also can see and manage the [[Ammo Types|type of ammunition]] loaded into the weapons in order for them to be more effective against incoming threats. 

The player manning the defensive weapons can also take manual control of individuals weapons, giving them a view similar to the one seen by Gunnery.
