The engineer would be responsible for managing the output of the Breaker's onboard power generators, setting each to a power-output that meets the needs of the Breaker, while also considering the risk of running a generator above it's safe output level. The engineer can also manage power by reducing how much power goes to various sub-systems (Above pictured has driving/helm, weapons, defensive systems, and life-support), with the engineer having to consider how much power a system needs vs what can be managed by the generators.
