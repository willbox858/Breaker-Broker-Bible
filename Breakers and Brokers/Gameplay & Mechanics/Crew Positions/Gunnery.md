![[Gunner.png]]

Above pictured is a mock-up of the gunner's view, where they are given an overview of the facing of various weapons, the magazine is pictured to the bottom left, allowing the gunner to know what shells they have loaded into their weapon. The reticle itself should have working ranging marks and mil marks, so that the player can effectively gauge how far from the target they are.

Above pictured is the "Ammo Cooker," where a player can design and allocate the rounds to be loaded into a magazine, with the player being able to modify various parameters of the ammo.

For example, the top round could be a traditional explosive shell, and the player can elect how many sections it has (above has 2 sections), what is in each section (above has two shaped charges), and parameters for each section (the angle of the shaped charge cone, or the [[Ammo Types|explosive filler]] used for example), as well as selecting the type of detonator on the warhead.

Continuing the example, the second round could be a long-rod penetrator, and the player could be responsible for deciding the length of the penetrator and the angle of the tip. 

While designing these rounds, the player should be concious of how much material is needed to make them. Longer long-rods would cost more material but be more effective penetrators, and explosive shells with more filler might be more lethal but take up greater amounts of explosives to be effective.
