The "Breaker" is the central vehicle of the game from the player's perspective. In order for it to operate effectively, it needs multiple players all taking on different roles onboard. Currently, the following positions are planned.

* [[Driving & Helm|Driver:]] Responsible for directing and actually driving the breaker. Has a limited first-person view from the driver's position, and might need help from other crew members for more precise driving.
* [[Gunnery|Gunner / Loader:]] Done by one but improved by two, the gunner's job is to operate the various offensive weapons on the Breaker, using them to attack either scavengers or hostile mega-fauna. The loader on the other hand is a secondary position, and can either take on operating weapons with the gunner, or can be responsible to cooking and selecting various ammo types for the gunner to use in the main weapons.
* [[Defensive Systems|CIWS / Defensive Ops:]] Again, done by one but improved by two, CIWS and Defensive Ops is responsible for managing the Breaker's defensive armaments, be they smoke systems, allocating firing arcs for defensive anti-missile systems, directing jamming systems to prevent missile and weapon locks, or manually controlling CIWS in order to engage with smaller targets close to the breaker.
* [[Captain|Captain:]] Responsible for directing the breaker as a whole. Largely a social position, they would have access to camera systems scattered throughout the interior and exterior of the Breaker in order to give themselves a clear picture of what's happening and what various crew members need to do. 
* [[Engineering|Engineer / Repairs:]] Responsible for managing the power output of the Breaker's engine, they can direct power to the various subsystems in order to improve their performance or reduce their allocated power so that more vital systems can stay running. Engineers and excess crew members would also be responsible for repairing the Breaker during combat, by either repairing damaged sub-systems or by patching holes in the hull with c-foam.
